DynamicTree.log v1.2

New in release 1.1
- Draw trees based on Fractal book algorithms
- Added input


New in release 1.2:
- Tried repeat variable - somewhat interesting and removed it
- Used setInterval and animated the drawing of trees
- Fixed bug that factors were not recalculated when the varibles changed
- Fixed bug where left and righ length factors were the same. Discovered Goofy tree. To recreate the bug must be put back.
- Display factors.


Backlog:
- Add seperate Alpha variable for left, right, width, and length
- Use ng-slider for variable control
- Save as button to export tree
